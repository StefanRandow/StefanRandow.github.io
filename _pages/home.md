Welcome to My Website, this site serves to host my personal projects, and act as an online Resume & Portfolio! 
My name is Stefan Randow, I am a Student at Metropolitan State University, where I study Math & Physics. Programming has become something of a hobby of mine lately, I have made Space Weather program, an 'Auto-Tweeter' and my latest project is this website.
