Here are some recent projects that I have been developing:

- Space Weather Interface
  
  This python programs connects to several NASA databases, collects some information, and then displays it to the user. Additionally, it can download several images and then compile them into a video for viewing.
- Python-Tweeter
  
  This is a python program that I have containerized for Docker. By reusing some of my code from Space Weather Interface, this program is capable of generating unique tweets based off of the current date, and the current space weather.
 
- This Website
  
  This website is also one of my projects, mostly to host an online version of my Resume, but I suspect I'll learn some HTML and CSS along the way :)
