Here are some recent projects that I have been developing:

- [Space Weather Interface](https://github.com/StefanRandow/Space_Weather_Interface/)
  
  This python programs connects to several NASA databases, collects some information, and then displays it to the user. Additionally, it can download several images and then compile them into a video for viewing. You can click [here](https://github.com/StefanRandow/Space_Weather_Interface/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the archive.

- [Python-Tweeter](https://github.com/StefanRandow/python-tweeter/)
  
  This is a python program that I have containerized for Docker. By modifying some code from The Space Weather Interface, this program is capable of generating unique tweets based off of the current date, and the current space weather. You can click [here](https://github.com/StefanRandow/python-tweeter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the archive.
 
- [StefanRandow.github.io](https://github.com/StefanRandow/stefanrandow.github.io)
  
  This website is also one of my projects, mostly to host an online version of my Resume, but I suspect I'll learn some HTML and CSS along the way :)
