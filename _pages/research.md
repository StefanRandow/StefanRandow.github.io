### Binary Black Hole Mergers & Gravitational Wave Quasi-Normal Modes

- I am currently part of a research team focused on Gravitational Wave Quasi-Normal Modes.
- Our latest paper investigates the stability of the fundamental mode of compact objects under perturbed conditions.
- My first paper as a contributing author is now available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17026).
- We are working on another paper examining the strange behavior of unstable ringdowns and the effects on extracting data from experimental observations at facilities such as LIGO and LISA.
