- Binary Black Hole Mergers & and Gravitational Wave Quasi Normal Modes  
<br> 
	- I am currently doing undergraduate research on Binary Black Hole Mergers, specifically in Gravitational Wave Quasinormal Modes:
	- When binary black hole systems merge, they warp the surrounding spacetime, which results in the emission of gravitational waves.
	- Immediately after the merger, the new black hole continues to vibrate the surrounding spacetime, however, these vibrations have a ring-down (they decay over time).

  	- Lately there has been uncertainty over whether the ring-down spectrum is stable when discontinuities/perturbations are introduced. I am part of a research team actively investigating this line of inquiry.
