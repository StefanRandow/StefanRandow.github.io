- Binary Black Hole Mergers & and Gravitatrional Wave Quasi Normal Modes\
- 
	- I am currently doing undergraduate research on Binary Black Hole Mergers, specifically in Gravitational Wave Quasinormal Modes:
	- When binary black hole systems merge, they warp the surroudning spacetime, which results in the emission of gravitational waves.
	- Immediately after the merger, the new black hole continues to vibrate the surrounding spacetime, however, these vibrations have a ring-down (they decay over time). This dampened vibration is modeled 	by the equation:

   $$ \Psi = \sum^p_{k=1} A_k e^{(\alpha_k+i\omega_k)t \ + \  i\varphi_k} $$
