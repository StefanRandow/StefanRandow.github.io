### Theoretical Physics in the field of Gravitational Wave Spectroscopy

- Since June 2023 I have been a researcher on an interdisciplinary team studying gravitational wave ringdowns of black holes.
- We primarily study the Quasinormal Mode (QNM) spectra of black holes under different models of gravitational potentials and spacetimes, primarily concerning instability due to perturbative effects.
- In my [first paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/r16b-7f4v) with this group, we derive a closed form analytical approximation that nicely models how the spectra changes with respect to perturbations. This is done for a toy model.
- In my [second paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/r16b-7f4v) with this group, we generalize the arguments in the first paper, and show that it works for a more general class of continuous gravitational potentials.
- We have another upcoming paper as well. I will link the arxiv for this paper when it is available on preprint.
