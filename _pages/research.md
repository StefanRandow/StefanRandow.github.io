- Binary Black Hole Mergers & Gravitational Wave Quasi Normal Modes  
<br> 
	- I am currently doing undergraduate research on Binary Black Hole Mergers, specifically in Gravitational Wave Quasinormal Modes.
	- Lately there has been uncertainty over whether the ring-down spectrum is stable when discontinuities/perturbations are introduced. I am part of a research team active in this line of inquiry.
	- Journal article to follow, pending pre-print on Arxiv, and publication in a journal.
