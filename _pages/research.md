- Binary Black Hole Mergers & Gravitational Wave Quasi Normal Modes  
<br> 
	- I am currently on a research team in the field of Gravitational Wave Quasinormal Modes.
	- Our latest paper is an investigation into the stability of the fundamental mode of compact objects under perturbed conditions.
   	- My first paper as a contributing author is now available on [the arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17026)
   	- We are working on another paper investigating the strange behavior of unstable ringdowns, and the effect on the etraction of data from experimental observations at facilities such as LIGO and LISA.
