 - Binary Black Hole Mergers & and Gravitatrional Wave Quasi Normal Modes
	- I am currently doing undergraduate research on Binary Black Hole Mergers, specifically in Gravitational Wave Quasinormal Modes:
	- When binary black hole systems merge, they warp the surroudning spacetime, which results in the emission of gravitational waves.
   	- Immediately after the merger, the new black hole continues to vibrate the surrounding spacetime, however, these vibrations have a ring-down - they decay over time.
   	- When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are $$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
   	-  {% raw %} $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$ --> note that all equations between these tags will not need escaping! {% endraw %}
